# Germinated-Palm-Oil-Seeds-Classification-using-MEAR
 
Germinated Palm Oil Seeds classification is my final year project. It is a private dataset with 3 different batches.

- Batch 1, which is used for training and validating
--Training set: 701 good seeds and 651 bad seeds.
--Validation set: 200 good/bad seeds.
- Batch 2 and batch 3 with different lighting conditions
--Batch 2: 450 good/bad seeds
--Batch 3: 305 good seeds and 693 bad seeds.
  
Identified overfitting problems occured when using pre-trained models to train in batch 1 and test in batch 2 and 3, I seek to solve the overfitting by enhancing the resilience and robustness of the models by using Multiexpert Adversarial Reguralization training.
